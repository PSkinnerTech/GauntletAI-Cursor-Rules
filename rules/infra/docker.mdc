# Docker & Containerization Standards

This rule enforces Docker best practices for Gauntlet AI projects.

## Multi-Stage Builds

Always use multi-stage builds for production applications:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Security Best Practices

- Use non-root users in containers
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images (alpine when possible)
- Never include secrets in images

## Docker Compose Guidelines

Structure your docker-compose files with:
- Environment-specific overrides
- Health checks for all services
- Proper network isolation
- Volume mounts for development
